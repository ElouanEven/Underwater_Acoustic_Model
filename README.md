# Modeling BELLHOP equation

Underwater acoustic using BELLHOP equation

Model include :
- Sound Speed Profile
- Reflexion for flat surface and bottom
- Varying sea bottom
- Absorption depending on frequency
- Intensity and transfer loss
- Receiver
    * detecting rays crossing
    * recording time and intensity delay
    * ploting only rays detect by receiver
- Second Hydrophone
- Segmentation in function
- Creating time signal at the source
- Add multiple receivers
- Recompose time signal on receivers
- Reduction of the range between source and receivers for time computation
- DaS Beamforming for direct rays
 
TO DO :
- Surface and bottom loss
- Beamforming
    * DaS
    * 
- Optimize code
- Discover 2D*N and 3D reprensentation
- Try different form of arrays
- Applying spherical harmonic on hydrophone

Corrections :
- Pic curvature not continuous 
- Scale everything down for time computation + Modification of variables physical nonsense
