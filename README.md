# Modeling BELLHOP equation

Underwater acoustic using BELLHOP equation

Model include :
- Sound Speed Profile
- Reflexion for flat surface and bottom
- Varying sea bottom
- Absorption depending on frequency
- Intensity and transfer loss
- Receiver
    * detecting rays crossing
    * recording time and intensity delay
    * ploting only rays detect by receiver
 
TO DO :
- Creating time signal at the source
- Resolution time delay expensive
- Recompose time signal on the hydrophone
- Surface and bottom loss
- Ray phases
- Add multiple Hydrophone
- Beamforming
    * DaS
    * 
- Optimize code
- Discover 2D*N and 3D reprensentation
- Try different form of arrays
- Applying spherical harmonic on hydrophone

Corrections :
-  Pic curvature not continuous
-
